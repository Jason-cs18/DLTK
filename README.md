# DLTK
_A hands-on tutorial for efficiently developing and deploying deep learning models._

- [x] Deep learning [model development](https://github.com/Jason-cs18/DLTK/tree/main/model_development): model design, model training & evaluation.
  - [ ] LLM development: data curation, model pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, reinforcement-based alignment.
  - [ ] Diffusion development: data curation, model pre-training, efficient fine-tuning.
- [x] Deep learning [model deployment](https://github.com/Jason-cs18/DLTK/tree/main/model_deployment): model optimization, inference server.
  - [ ] LLM optimizations: vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM.
  - [ ] Diffusion optimizations: diffusers, OneDiff.
- [ ]  [Model optimizations](https://github.com/MLSysTeam/DLTK/tree/main/model_optimizations): hardware-aware optimizations, LLM-specific optimizations, Diffusion-specific optimizations.
- [ ] An interactive [demo](https://github.com/Jason-cs18/DLTK/tree/main/web_demo) for deep learning models: Gradio, Streamlit, React.
