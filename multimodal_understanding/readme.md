# Multimodal Understanding

This guide provides an overview of how to utilize existing multimodal models to address a variety of vision tasks, categorized into basic and advanced levels based on the challenges of data collection.

- **Basic Vision Tasks**: Tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, where it is relatively easy to collect sufficient training data or build large-scale datasets at a low cost.

- **Advanced Vision Tasks**: More complex tasks like image/video retrieval and visual reasoning, which often require expert-level annotations and more human priors.
